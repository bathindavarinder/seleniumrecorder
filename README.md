# Selenium Recorder

If you are using selenium wedriver for automation of Web Application. It is always tedious task to create page object model or page factory. You have to inspect and search properties for controls.

and in some cases, if automation ID is not present, which generally happpens, it is difficult to decide what is the best ways to identify controls.

To tackle these issue, I have create a WPF application which will help you generate POM or Page factory. 

You just need to load your application, select controls you want to include and cilck on generate button, like we do in CODED UI Test Builder.
